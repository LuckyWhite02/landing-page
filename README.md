# landing-page
Starting my second project called landing-page.Practising css flex.
Finished the header!
Finished the whole page.Learned a lot about flexbox and also some stylistic css.
Finished the last touches.
Organized the overall structure of the code.
Pretty cool project,fun to do and improved my overall flexbox skills! Was a bit hard at the begining but after i finished the header the rest was much easier.
